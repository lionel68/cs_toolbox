**What**: In this workshop we will consider the challenges of different types of CS data ranging from structured, semi-structured and opportunistic data. We will especially focus on accounting for biases (such as spatial) and heterogeneity in observational and sampling processes. 

**For whom**: The course is targeted towards ecologists that:

* have experience using R
* have basic knowledge of Generalized Linear Mixed effect Models
* are working (or planning to work) with CS data


**Who**: Diana Bowler, Lionel Hertzog and Swantje Loebel

**When**: Sunday 29.08.2021, Time 9:30 – 17:30 (CET)

**Where**: Online via Zoom/Slack

### (tentative) Program 

* 09:30 – 09:45: Lecture: Welcoming words, schedule for the session, how the workshop will be organized (chat, repository …) [Swantje]

* 09:45 – 10:15: Lecture: Introduction into the large diversity of citizen science data from structured monitoring programs relying on volunteers (breeding bird survey) to opportunistic observations (GBIF …) and the bias associated with it (site selection, reporting bias, detection issues …) and simple trend models. [Diana]

* 10:15 – 10:45: Coding: fitting a trend model (time and maybe space) to structured data [the idea there could be to give simulated data to the participants with some detection/reporting bias in the observation process and compare after the session the estimated temporal/ spatial pattern with the true one to demonstrate how not accounting for this bias can lead to spurious results] [Lionel]

* 11:00 – 11:30: Lecture: introduction to occupancy models [Swantje]

* 11:30 – 12:00: Coding: fitting occupancy models using R (unmarked) and JAGS (?) [Swantje]

* 12:00 – 13:00: Lunch break

* 13:00 – 13:15: exchange time

* 13:15 – 13:45: Lecture: more advanced occupancy models (more than one species, dynamic occupancy models) [Diana]

* 13:45 – 14:15: Coding: fitting more advanced occupancy models using JAGS [Diana]

* 14:15 – 14:45: Lecture: introduction into spatial models (INLA and inlabru), [lecture file](docs/05_spatial_models.html)

* 14:45 – 15:15: Coding: fitting spatial models (inlabru) [Lionel]

* 15:15 – 15:45: Lecture: Integrated modelling approaches (combined what we learn earlier) [Diana]

* 15:45 – 16:15: Coding: fitting integrated models (INLA, Stan?) [Lionel / Diana]

* 16:15 – End: Open discussion, Stats troubleshooting, data health checks
